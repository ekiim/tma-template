# My TMA Template

> [Example Document](./example.pdf)

Currently, I'm going through some courses in which I need to submit assessments about math.
Hence, I write most of the work in LaTeX.

This repo contains the template I've refined over a cycle of the courses.

I provide some examples on how to use the _common_ symbols used in those subjects.

The recommendation for this is to modify whatever extra configurations are in the `TMA.cls` file, as it helps reduce the noise in the document itself, allowing you to focus on your content.

I have a couple of macros to create the question section, to write derivatives, and to create solution environment.

Also, it uses a bibliography file, which you can edit, to add the books you are using, and cite them; the citation will show in the footnote for the page, as I don't think it's important to have a full references page for this type of document.

# Download

If you are checking this file template and visualizing this on GitHub, I would recommend clicking on the **big green button that says code** and downloading it as `zip`.

If you know how to use `git` then I guess you know how to download it by other means.


# Contributions

I'm open to suggestions and improvements; if you think there is something cool I can add, I would appreciate the pull request or suggestion.
